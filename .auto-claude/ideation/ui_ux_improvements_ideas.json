      "description": "The FAQ component (FAQ.tsx) is missing aria-expanded attribute on accordion buttons, unlike the ServiceFAQ component which implements it correctly. This is an accessibility issue for screen reader users.",
      "rationale": "Screen reader users need aria-expanded to understand the state of expandable content. This is a WCAG 2.1 AA requirement for accessible interactive disclosure widgets.",
      "category": "accessibility",
      "affected_components": ["src/components/sections/FAQ.tsx"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "FAQ accordion buttons have no aria-expanded attribute. The button at line 89-91 only toggles openIndex state but doesn't communicate expansion state to assistive technologies.",
      "proposed_change": "Add aria-expanded={openIndex === index} to the FAQ accordion button element. Also add aria-controls pointing to the content panel id, similar to the pattern in ServiceFAQ.tsx at line 57.",
      "user_benefit": "Screen reader users will know whether each FAQ item is expanded or collapsed, improving navigation and understanding of the page structure.",

      "description": "The FAQ accordion content currently appears/disappears abruptly with no animation. Adding a smooth height transition would improve perceived quality and reduce cognitive load.",
      "rationale": "Smooth animations help users understand state changes and reduce jarring visual shifts. The codebase already uses animations extensively (animate-fade-in, animate-slide-up) showing this pattern is expected.",

      "current_state": "FAQ content at lines 110-114 uses conditional rendering with no transition: {openIndex === index && (<div>...</div>)}. Content appears/disappears instantly.",
      "proposed_change": "Implement CSS grid animation pattern: wrap content in container with grid-template-rows: 0fr transitioning to 1fr, or use a height transition with overflow-hidden. Add animate-fade-in class to content panel for smooth entry.",
      "user_benefit": "Smoother, more polished interaction that feels premium and helps users track visual changes without jarring jumps.",
