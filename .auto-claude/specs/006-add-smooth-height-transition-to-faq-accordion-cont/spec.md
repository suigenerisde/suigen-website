# Add smooth height transition to FAQ accordion content

## Overview

The FAQ accordion content currently appears/disappears abruptly with no animation. Adding a smooth height transition would improve perceived quality and reduce cognitive load.

## Rationale

Smooth animations help users understand state changes and reduce jarring visual shifts. The codebase already uses animations extensively (animate-fade-in, animate-slide-up) showing this pattern is expected.
