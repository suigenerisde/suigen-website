# Replace default README with project-specific documentation

## Overview

The README.md is still the default Next.js template. It contains no information about SUI-GENERIS or the Fokus-Check application, missing critical project overview, business context, and project-specific setup instructions.

## Rationale

The README is the first file developers see. A generic template provides no value for onboarding team members or understanding the Fokus-Check system. New developers must reverse-engineer the codebase to understand its purpose.
