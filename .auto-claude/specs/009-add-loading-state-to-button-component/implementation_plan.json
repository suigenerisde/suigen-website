  "feature": "Add Loading State to Button Component",
  "description": "Enhance the Button component with a built-in loading state that displays a spinner and disables interaction. Currently, loading states are handled inline in components like DeliveryChoice with 'Wird gesendet...' text. A standardized loading prop would ensure consistent loading UX across all buttons.",
