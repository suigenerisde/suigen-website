# Add Keyboard Navigation to FAQ Accordion

## Overview

Enhance the FAQ component with keyboard navigation support. Users should be able to navigate between FAQ items using arrow keys and toggle items with Enter/Space. This follows accessibility best practices for accordion components.

## Rationale

The FAQ component has onClick handlers for toggling items but lacks keyboard support. The pattern for handling keyboard events exists in other components (e.g., form inputs). Adding keyboard navigation would improve accessibility without significant code changes.
