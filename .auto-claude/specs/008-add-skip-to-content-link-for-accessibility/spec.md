# Add Skip-to-Content Link for Accessibility

## Overview

Add a visually hidden skip-to-content link at the beginning of the Header component that becomes visible on focus. This allows keyboard users to skip navigation and jump directly to main content, following WCAG accessibility guidelines.

## Rationale

The Header component has comprehensive navigation with multiple links. Keyboard users must tab through all nav items to reach main content. Skip links are a standard accessibility pattern that can be implemented with the existing Tailwind CSS utilities already used in the project.
